# Automated-Data-Driven-Approach-to-Crime-Pattern-Detection-and-Prediction

This project aims to:
1. Develop a novel automated data-driven system to accurately detect crime patterns from large-scale datasets to support crime prevention and predictive policing, to enhance the decision making of the law enforcement agencies.
2. Employ Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), machine learning algorithms and data mining methods to analyse the crime and automatically identify crime trends that are committed by same offenders and similar offenses in Derbyshire area, using real datasets from police force in UK.

This project objectives include:
1. To conduct comprehensive the state-of-the-art literature review in the areas of crime patterns, data mining/machine learning.
2. Training machine learning models for predicting crime types and outcomes.

3. Analysing and detecting crime patterns based on spatial and temporal trends across Derbyshire area using real datasets.
4. To evaluate the modelâ€™s effectiveness in crime prediction.
5. Using explainable AI (XAI) techniques to provide insights and enable more efficient resource allocation in the crime pattern analysis.
